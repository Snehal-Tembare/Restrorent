# Restrorent
This app is created as POC for learning of Dagger2 and VIPER architecture in Android.
The first commit has boiler plate code for the migration of existing app in Dagger2 and VIPER wich is not a runnable code.
Which is going to be fixed in next  future  commits.
The app is a restaurent app where a user can search for restaurent for near by loaction  and provide the path  to it using google Map .
